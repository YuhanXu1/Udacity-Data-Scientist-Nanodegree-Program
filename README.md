## [Disaster Response Pipelines](/Disaster-Response-Pipelines)
- Analyzed disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages
- built an NLP pipeline using NLTK and Scikit-learn to classify the messages
- Developed a web app using Plotly and Flask to visualize the dataset and classify new messages
## [Recommendations with IBM](/Recommendations-with-IBM)
- Analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform
- Made recommendations about new articles using rank-based recommendations, user-based collaborative filtering, and SVD
## [Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services](/Arvato-Project)
- Summarized the characteristics of Arvato's core customer base by comparing the demographics of general population and its customers
- Used PCA to find out the most important features and used k-means clustering to segment and compare the general population and its customers
- Built a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign and become customers
- Wrote a post about the whole process and main findings on [Medium](https://yuhanxu.medium.com/customer-segmentation-report-for-arvato-financial-services-4ea4eae1f2c8)
