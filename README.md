This repository includes all the projects I did in Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.
## [Write a Data Science Blog Post](/Udacity-Write-a-DS-Blog-Post)
- Analyzed 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to know how to break into data jobs with a business background
- Cleaned and analyzed the data using Pandas and Numpy, then visualized the result using Matplotlib
- Wrote a post about the findings on [Medium](https://medium.com/@xyhmars/how-can-you-break-into-data-jobs-with-a-business-background-5f735c094f99)
## [Disaster Response Pipelines](/Disaster-Response-Pipelines)
- Analyzed disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages
- built an NLP pipeline using NLTK and Scikit-learn to classify the messages
- Developed a web app using Plotly and Flask to visualize the dataset and classify new messages
## [Recommendations with IBM](/Recommendations-with-IBM)
- Analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform
- Made recommendations about new articles using rank-based recommendations, user-based collaborative filtering, and SVD
