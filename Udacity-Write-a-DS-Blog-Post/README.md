## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
This is the first project of Data Scientist Nanodegree on Udacity.
For this project, I was interested in using the data from the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to know how to break into data jobs with a business background. More specifically, how I can start a career as a data analyst or data scientist. 

Here are the specific questions:

1. What are the education backgrounds of these data analysts and data scientists?
2. For those who studied business, what help them to become a data analyst or data scientist?
3. What technologies do data analysts or data scientists prefer in their companies?
4. What kinds of interview would be like?
5. What factors do these data analysts and data scientists care the most when choosing jobs?

## File Descriptions
The notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available here.
